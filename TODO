* Block expressions: Requires adding lookahead buffer to scanner
* Default handlers (e.g. link, each, etc.)
* Better handling of "expressions": e.g., support types like bool, int, etc.
  This will require some refactoring in the parser.
* Escaping handlebars expressions like \{{sometext}}
* Dot-slash "./" expressions
* HTML-escaping expressions
* Whitespace-chomping expressions
* Consider removing Hbs/hbs_ prefix from some internal types?
* Logger
* v0.4.0 Release (Mostly production ready)
* Allocation-free interface
* Handler/Key load-time resolution (allow for int comp., vs. string comp.)
* Fix symbol exports (gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility)
* CI/CD Platform
* abidiff integration
* Doxygen docs
